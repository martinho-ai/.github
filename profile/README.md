## About

The aim of the project is to help the UEFN creator community, especially developers working with Verse, with open source tools and projects.

## Ideas

Below I will mention some project ideas that I have in mind to put into practice with a brief description.

[AI Chat](http://github.com/martinho-ai/chat) • A chat based on the various AI models present on the market such as ChatGPT, capable of generating Verse codes, and can work together with your workspace.

[AI Copilot](https://github.com/martinho-ai/copilot) • An extension for text editors capable of generating code suggestions based on your workspace.

[Verse Editor](https://github.com/martinho-ai/editor) • An IDE focused on Verse (with most other projects already integrated such as Chat and Copilot), in addition to direct integration with UEFN.
